Boston’s Pop-Up ShopTracker using Python.
 
The Pop-Up ShopTracker software is a valuable tool for both store owners and consumers in Boston who are looking for pop-up stores. It offers a comprehensive and organized view of stores, helping users find the nearest locations and discover trends and popularity that are often overlooked by traditional analysis methods. By using this program, shop owners and customers can develop more effective strategies for locating shops and determining the availability of goods.

One of the main functions of the software is to provide a summary of the goods availability in a specific area and time period. It accurately represents the number of available goods in the designated area during the specified time frame. This data can be used to track changes in shop inventory and create strategies to meet the demand in areas with high customer interest. Additionally, it provides detailed information about the goods themselves, including their price, location, date, and time. This information is crucial for identifying neighborhoods or streets with the highest availability of shops and analyzing shopping patterns and trends. Customers can utilize this information to efficiently find their desired stores and locate the materials they need.

Furthermore, the software can display the most common categories of shops within the dataset. This feature offers an overview of the most popular and in-demand shops in the city by analyzing the availability of goods in each shop category. This information can be used to allocate resources to areas and shops with high demand, as well as devise strategies to attract more customers.

The ShopTracker software is a powerful tool that provides valuable insights for both shop owners and customers in Boston. It enables users to efficiently locate shops, track goods availability and prices, and identify popular store categories, helping them make informed decisions and optimize their shopping experiences.
 
How the program was built
This code defines a shop class with shop_type, area, and date attributes. The system then generates a list of transgressions titled "shops." The program's menu-driven interface enables the user to select from a variety of functions. The initial function summarizes all data by invoking the summarize_by_area() and summarize_by_date() functions. The second function summarizes the number of shops available by geographic area, while the third function summarizes the number of pop-up shops available by date. The fourth function provides shop-specific information. The fifth function determines the most prevalent form of shop from the list of shops. The sixth function writes the output of the summarize_all_data() function to a text file named "shop_summary.txt."
The program uses input statements to prompt the user for the required input before calling the corresponding function to process the input. If the user selects to summarize by area, for instance, the program prompts the user to enter the area before calling the summarize_by_area() function to calculate the number of shops in that area. Similarly, if the user selects to discover the most prevalent shop type, the program calls the find_most_common_shop() method.
How to use the program
Run the program in a Python environment using Spyder 3.0.
The program will display a menu with six options:
Summarize all the data.
Summarize by area.
Summarize by date.
Detail by shop type
Find the most common shop type.
Exit
To choose an option, enter the corresponding number (1-6).
If you choose option 1, the program will summarize all the data in the shop list and display the area with the most stores, the date with the most shops open, and the most common store type.
If you choose option 2, the program will prompt you to enter an area. Enter the name of the area (“Downtown” or “OutletMall”), and the program will display the number of pop-up shops opened in that area.
If you choose option 3, the program will prompt you to enter a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD. Enter a date, and the program will display the number of shops that are open on that date.
If you choose option 4, the program will prompt you to enter a shop type. Enter the name of the shop type (“Shirts”, “Pants”, “Shoes”, or “Coats”) and the program will display the details of all the goods of that shop type.
If you choose option 5, the program will display the most common shop type.
If you choose option 6, the program will summarize all the data in the shop list and write it to a file named shop_summary.txt. Then the program will terminate.
If you enter an invalid choice (a number outside the range 1-6), the program will display an error message and prompt you to enter a valid choice.
